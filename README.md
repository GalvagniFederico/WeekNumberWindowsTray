- **System Theme Integration**: Option to automatically match the text color with the system theme (light or dark mode).
- **Persistent Settings**: Save your preferred settings (font size and text color) for use across sessions.
- **Runs in Background**: The app runs silently in the background, without taking up taskbar space.

## How It Works

- The app calculates the current week number based on the system date using the "First Four-Day Week" rule.
- The icon is generated dynamically, with the week number drawn onto it in the specified font size and color.
- A context menu allows you to adjust settings or exit the application.

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
